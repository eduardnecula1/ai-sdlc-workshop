# Tutor guide — AI SDLC with Github Copilot and HVE Core

This guide is for tutors and facilitators. It holds **all timing** for both workshops (240 minutes for GitHub Copilot Zero to Hero; an estimated 255 for the AI SDLC workshop), the pre-flight checklist, known risks and messaging guardrails. The attendee guides contain no time codes, so keep timing changes in this file and their duration metadata synchronized.

- Attendee content: [GitHub Copilot Zero to Hero](afternoon-1/workshop.md) and [AI SDLC with Github Copilot and HVE Core](afternoon-2/workshop.md)
- Attendee checklist: [prerequisites and pre-D-Day checks](prerequisites.md), or the per-option checklists for [Codespaces](before-d-day-codespace.md), [local dev container](before-d-day-devcontainer.md) and [local tools](before-d-day-local.md)
- Maintaining the content: [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md)

GitHub Copilot Zero to Hero runs the official [GHCopilotHoL](https://moaw.dev/workshop/gh:Philess/GHCopilotHoL/main/docs/) lab on attendee forks of [Philess/gh-copilot-demo](https://github.com/Philess/gh-copilot-demo), then adds Levels 7 to 9 and an advanced **Deeper primitives** page from this repository. AI SDLC with Github Copilot and HVE Core switches to the Music Catalog template in this repository.

## GitHub Copilot Zero to Hero (240 min)

| Start | Block | Minutes | Source | Checkpoint |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0:00 | Setup: fork gh-copilot-demo, open Codespaces or local | 15 | This guide + upstream introduction | Fork opened, front end running |
| 0:15 | Part 1 — Upstream Level 1 Code Completion | 25 | GHCopilotHoL | Completions accepted |
| 0:40 | Part 1 — Upstream Level 2 Copilot Chat | 30 | GHCopilotHoL | Chat fixes and tests |
| 1:10 | Part 1 — Upstream Level 3 Agent Basics | 20 | GHCopilotHoL | Agent change reviewed |
| 1:30 | Part 1 — Upstream Level 4 Plan & Implement | 25 | GHCopilotHoL | Plan implemented, Code Review run |
| 1:55 | Break | 15 | | Work committed |
| 2:10 | Part 2 — Upstream Level 5 Advanced Concepts (instructions, prompts, MCP) | 25 | GHCopilotHoL | Instructions, prompt files, MCP |
| 2:35 | Part 2 — Upstream Level 6 Copilot cloud agent and custom agents on github.com | 20 | GHCopilotHoL | Copilot cloud agent PR opened |
| 2:55 | Level 7 Agent Skills | 15 | This repository | Skill committed |
| 3:10 | Level 8 Copilot CLI | 25 | This repository | Endpoint added from CLI |
| 3:35 | Level 9 Agent Plugins and marketplaces | 15 | This repository | Plugin installed then removed |
| 3:50 | Recap | 10 | This repository | |
| 4:00 | End | | | |

Part 1 totals 100 minutes and Part 2 totals 45 minutes. On the standard track, the **Deeper primitives** page is for early finishers only.

**If late:** upstream Levels 1 to 6 are the core. Skip the upstream side quests first, then shorten Level 9 to the CLI plugin commands only.

### Fast track for advanced developers and architects

Use this variant when most attendees already use agent mode daily. Send upstream Levels 1 to 4 as pre-work, or run them as a 20-minute facilitator demo, and spend the time saved on the **Deeper primitives** page.

| Start | Block | Minutes | Source | Checkpoint |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0:00 | Setup: fork gh-copilot-demo, open Codespaces or local | 15 | This guide + upstream introduction | Fork opened, front end running |
| 0:15 | Part 1 — Upstream Levels 1 to 4 as a facilitator demo (or pre-work) | 20 | GHCopilotHoL | Attendees can explain why a reviewed plan beats a reviewed diff |
| 0:35 | Part 2 — Upstream Level 5 Advanced Concepts | 30 | GHCopilotHoL | Instructions, prompt files, MCP |
| 1:05 | Part 2 — Upstream Level 6 Copilot cloud agent and custom agents | 25 | GHCopilotHoL | Copilot cloud agent PR opened; assign the issue first so it runs during the next blocks |
| 1:30 | Level 7 Agent Skills | 20 | This repository | Skill committed |
| 1:50 | Break | 15 | | Work committed |
| 2:05 | Level 8 Copilot CLI | 30 | This repository | Endpoint added from CLI |
| 2:35 | Deeper primitives: instruction layering, guardrail hook, MCP governance | 50 | This repository | Path-specific instruction applied, `git push` denied by the hook, MCP inventory done |
| 3:25 | Level 9 Agent Plugins and marketplaces | 20 | This repository | Plugin installed then removed |
| 3:45 | Recap, with the autonomy ladder | 15 | This repository | |
| 4:00 | End | | | |

In the recap, walk the autonomy ladder explicitly and point out that the upstream lab reaches Copilot cloud agent (Level 6) before Copilot CLI (Level 8). Ask the room which controls from the Deeper primitives page they would need before letting the cloud agent work on their own repositories.

## AI SDLC with Github Copilot and HVE Core (255 min, estimated)

| Start | Block | Minutes | Checkpoint | If late |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0:00 | Introduction and prerequisite readiness | 10 | Prerequisites already complete; unblock attendees if needed | Skip checks already completed before the workshop |
| 0:10 | Level 1 HVE-Core plugin | 10 | `copilot plugin list` shows hve-core | Use the VS Code extension |
| 0:20 | Level 2 Design Thinking | 20 | Learner-led sampler, honest nine-method recap, shared implementation handoff | Preview remaining methods without claiming completion; hand out only the implementation contract |
| 0:40 | Level 2 Curate what you commit | 10 | Reviewed delivery brief saved, curated files committed, `.copilot-tracking` ignored | Inspect the staged file tree; commit only reviewed planning documents |
| 0:50 | Level 3 RPI, with context engineering and the duplicate-add decision | 65 | Playlist feature merged, tests green, decision debriefed | Share your finished branch; keep the 5-minute decision debrief |
| 1:55 | Break | 10 | Implementation committed, tests pass | |
| 2:05 | Level 4 Curated marketplace and trusted repository agents | 45 | Own catalog registered; curated HVE verified, then personal CLI plugin disabled; repository agents, lockfile and audit published | Begin installation early; use recorded evidence without claiming blocked installs passed |
| 2:50 | Level 5a Verification as contract | 20 | CI and Copilot setup published; `test` and strict `apm-audit` checks required | Show prepared check evidence; publish initial setup before enabling the strict audit rule |
| 3:10 | Level 5b Backlog and delegation | 30 | Managed issue has committed planning evidence; RPI cloud task visible on the issue/Project; separate accessibility demo | Show a prepared reconciliation and reviewed setup PR; do not bypass the strict audit gate |
| 3:40 | Level 6 Independently review and accept | 20 | Copilot review posted on the RPI PR; human decision and issue/Project outcome recorded | Use a prepared PR/review; keep this block on revision-bound acceptance evidence |
| 4:00 | Recap and architect capstone | 15 | | Keep the recap to 5 minutes; if licensed, show the facilitator-only push-protection demo, then run the capstone as a discussion |
| 4:15 | End | | | |

The added marketplace practice extends Level 4 by fifteen minutes rather than
cutting APM. These timings are estimates; live client installation and delivery
timing have not been replayed.

Level 3 and the break together form a 75-minute block. Stop the room at the plan gate for the duplicate-feedback decision, then run a 5-minute debrief after Review: ask attendees with contrasting choices to explain the trade-off. Do not prescribe two options before the planner explores them. In Level 5a, publish the initial CI and Copilot setup before enabling the strict APM audit rule. In Level 5b, complete the reviewed workflow/planning setup and select an issue only after its planning evidence is committed. While the cloud task runs, follow issue/Project progress and show the separate accessibility demo. Agent latency is variable; keep a completed PR ready for Level 6. The Extra Credits page is optional.

### Level 4 proctor flow

Use the question **"What must travel with the repository before a teammate or cloud agent can use this method?"** Keep the hands-on work in the existing Music Catalog repository.

| Minutes | Activity |
| --- | --- |
| 0-3 | Personal context versus repository-owned capabilities |
| 3-6 | Inspect template-shipped catalog and four remote entries |
| 6-18 | Register attendee owner/repo in CLI/VS Code; inspect existing HVE source, consented qualified removal, curated install and agent verification |
| 18-21 | Compare catalog/plugin versions and source SHA; brief app registration demo |
| 21-29 | APM manifest, install, actual agent files, resolved commit |
| 29-32 | Disable exact curated personal HVE CLI plugin; handle separate VS Code instance and verify repository agents |
| 32-37 | Policy status, audit, deny-and-restore |
| 37-42 | Audit workflow, staged-diff review, commit and push |
| 42-45 | Verify default-branch files and audit; connect to cloud delegation |

The organization-sharing comparison must use the documented **`.github-private`** name, not the `.copilot-private` shorthand used in the early discussion. Explain enterprise-wide governance as an Enterprise Owner route. Do not label every organization-level custom agent Enterprise-only or claim that standalone prompts/skills automatically distribute through this repository.

For portability, distinguish `apm compile` (instructions/context files) from `apm install` (agents, skills, and other supported primitives). The curated personal install is separate from APM's pinned repository dependency; do not update the APM SHA to match the marketplace.

#### Curated marketplace and app demo

Use each learner's `.github/plugin/marketplace.json`: HVE-Core 3.2.2, Java Development,
Java Modernization Studio and WorkIQ. Register the **attendee copy**, not the
original workshop repository. Read its remote `repo`, optional `path`, and `sha`;
do not copy upstream relative source strings into the company repository.

Only HVE is a required install. Java source payloads are missing at the selected
revision; WorkIQ needs service access and has read/write capabilities. Keep all
three as browse examples; no tenant setup or runtime promises.

Watch `copilot plugin list --json` before and after the transition. Accept only the
known Level 1 identity or the sole curated identity; stop for duplicates/unknown
sources. The learner consents before uninstalling `hve-core@hve-core`, confirms
absence, then installs `hve-core@contoso-plugin-marketplace`. Failures/managed
restrictions are incomplete readiness, never an invitation to force a replacement.

For the GitHub Copilot app, demonstrate registering this same attendee-owned catalog
and browsing/installing HVE in an authorized tutor profile. This is an app-only demo,
not a claim that Java Studio's canvas renders in VS Code. Preflight actual app UI;
if unavailable, say it was not demonstrated. The retained
[private catalog capture](afternoon-2/assets/l4-private-marketplace.png) is an optional
historical comparison, not evidence attendees registered that private repository.

Explain the publishing path: reviewed source pin and matching version metadata,
catalog version bump, PR validation, client catalog refresh, then plugin update.
Catalog discovery is not an APM approved-source rule or enforced company governance.
Enterprise-managed `strictKnownMarketplaces`/`enabledPlugins` are separate controls.

Do not reinstall personal HVE after the final APM disable. Keep the
[duplicate-agent screenshot](afternoon-2/assets/l4-duplicate-agent-entries.png) for
separate VS Code/managed instances. The solution settings file is illustrative;
copying its enable overlay would block the later local disable.

### Level 5a proctor flow

Publish the initial CI and Copilot setup files before activating the strict no-bypass APM audit rule. Verify the required checks against the latest default-branch commit; the static ruleset example is not evidence that live enforcement is active.

### Level 5b proctor flow

Demonstrate a real issue linked to the committed Level 2 brief and remove-feature follow-up. Explain each state change by its evidence, not by an agent's conclusion.

Before delivery, prepare three examples: a planning-only issue that remains open, an open PR that produces a progress comment, and a fully resolving merged PR with fixing-commit/check evidence. Add `backlog-managed` explicitly; keep an unlabelled control issue unchanged. Rerun once with unchanged evidence to check duplicate suppression. Do not seed fake defects merely to make the report busy.

For the dashboard, prepare a shared Project and its actual Status choices. Use people to set intermediate states and the built-in **Item closed** transition for Done. Keep status-to-issue closure off. This avoids treating a board move as acceptance and avoids a privileged Project token in the attendee workflow. ProjectOps with separate read/write credentials is an optional organizational extension, not part of this lab.

#### Accessibility: separate 5-minute demo while the coding task runs

Use prepared output from the private
[CoffeeSoft scheduled audit](https://github.com/CoffeesoftDotDev/accessibility-copilot/blob/main/.github/workflows/a11y-scheduled-audit.md),
its [repository conventions](https://github.com/CoffeesoftDotDev/accessibility-copilot/blob/main/.github/copilot-instructions.md),
and [Awesome Copilot](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot). Do not ask attendees to access the private repository, compile its workflow, configure MCP, or run an audit.

Show [the supplied repository MCP capture](afternoon-2/assets/l5-playwright-mcp.png). Its settings apply to cloud agent/code review; they do not configure local CLI/IDEs or the scheduled gh-aw job. The screenshot notes default Playwright availability: check the effective tool list before adding another server. The pictured `@latest` is demonstration configuration, not a pinned team standard.

Contrast it with the scheduled source's own `tools: playwright: mode: cli`. A browser tool still needs a reachable application. In your prepared run, show a keyboard/focus or accessible-name observation, its evidence, and the corresponding tracked issue. Do not call source-only checks or a browser snapshot a real screen-reader test.

Close with the audit-only boundary, explicit untested coverage, and finding deduplication. Explain `fix(a11y): ...` as a remediation convention, not enforcement: branch/workflow conditions prevent recursive runs, and builds/tests must still run for fixes. Keep cognitive-design heuristics separate from normative criteria and avoid compliance-certification language.

### Level 6 proctor checkpoints

Verify that **Copilot code review actually posted** on the delegated RPI implementation PR. A coding session's self-review is not that review. After substantial fixes, request another review and inspect the latest checks.

Keep workflow approval and merge as human decisions. After a fully resolving merge, show the issue's PR/commit link and Project Done transition. For a partial fix, show the remaining criteria and keep the issue open. The daily reconciliation can clean up mismatches but must not equate any merged PR with completion.

For Level 2, allocate 10–15 minutes to the learner-led nine-method sampler and the remaining time to the debrief, shared implementation handoff, and saved-note inspection. Encourage different listening contexts and concepts; do not distribute the six playlist decisions as the brainstorming answer. Use the native Method Next prompt to show state-based recommendations, not to force progress past missing evidence. Prioritize learner contributions in Methods 1–6 and preview Methods 7–9 if time runs short. Tell attendees when the timebox ends; model latency makes this a pacing target, not a guaranteed duration. Never mark simulated research or planned testing as completed evidence.

Use the existing 10-minute curation allocation to save the shared brief with Documentation before the optional PM track, then review and commit the planning files afterwards. Do not add a second writing exercise. In the PM track, retain the supplied business facts and three-question limits, but let the builders choose their questions, templates, traceability, and quality checks. Point out a useful question, an evidence gap, and a native quality-review or handoff decision; these show more HVE value than matching a reference document.

### Extended tracks (outside the 255-minute core agenda)

The core agenda above does not include the role-based extended tracks. Choose how to use them before the day:

| Track | Where | Extra minutes | HVE-Core role guide | Best use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Product Manager: DT Coach → (Meeting Analyst) → BRD Builder → PRD Builder → Functional Planner → Backlog Manager → GitHub issues | End of Level 2 | about 40 | TPM, Business Program Manager (beta) | Hands-on for a PM-heavy room, otherwise a facilitator demo |
| Tech Lead: ADR Creator, Code Review agent, `/git-commit` | End of Level 3 | 10 to 15 | Tech Lead, Engineer | Early finishers |
| Security Architect: report-only security review delegated to Copilot cloud agent | End of Level 5 | about 20, plus agent run time | Security Architect | Facilitator demo, or hands-on for a security-focused room |

Hands-on extended tracks require extra time or a separately agreed agenda change;
do not silently remove the required marketplace or APM practice. For a PM-only
audience, agree a separate track using the introduction, Levels 1-2 and the Product
Manager extension, then Level 5, with the remaining content demonstrated explicitly.

Rules for the tracks:
- Meeting Analyst needs a Microsoft 365 Copilot licence and WorkIQ, and cannot read local transcripts. Always demo it yourself, or skip it.
- Only `/backlog-execute` writes to GitHub. Make attendees read the Functional Planner handoff before they confirm.
- Present the HVE-Core security agents as assistive only. They never replace SAST, DAST, SCA, or qualified human review.
- The gh-aw label-gated delegation (`security-review-delegation.md`) needs a fine-grained PAT stored as `GH_AW_AGENT_TOKEN`. Use your own sandbox and delete the PAT afterwards. Do not ask attendees to create one.
- Hand-written reference outputs for all three tracks (BRD, PRD, backlog handoff, ADR, security report) are in [solutions/afternoon-2/docs](../solutions/afternoon-2/docs/README.md). Use them as labelled facilitator fallbacks, not output shapes or exact wording attendees must reproduce.

## Pre-flight (day before)

1. Run the AI SDLC smoke test on a fresh copy of the repository:
   1. Create the copy using the introduction's **Dev Environment Setup** instructions and complete **Starter readiness (prerequisite)**.
   2. Run `copilot plugin marketplace add microsoft/hve-core` and `copilot plugin install hve-core@hve-core`.
   3. Run `apm install` with the pinned `apm.yml`, then `apm policy status --policy-source apm-policy.yml`.
   4. Publish the follow-up brief and link it from an opted-in `backlog-managed` issue. Run `gh aw compile` and `gh aw run daily-backlog`, then confirm the evidence comment and summary. No delivered fix means the issue stays open.
   5. Copy `solutions/afternoon-2/.github/workflows/ci.yml`, push it, and confirm the `test` check passes. Create the ruleset from `solutions/afternoon-2/rulesets/main-tests-required.json` and confirm it appears under **Settings** > **Rules** > **Rulesets**.
   6. Assign a test issue to Copilot and confirm a pull request opens and the `test` check runs after you approve the workflows.
2. Compare the upstream repositories with the pinned commits listed in [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md#upstream-pins), and adjust the timings above if levels changed.
3. Record these fallback artifacts: passing and failing policy audits, a planning-evidence backlog update, an open-PR update, a verified completed fix, the private accessibility demo output, a cloud-agent PR with completed Copilot review, and a push rejected by the workshop custom pattern.
4. Check that the HVE-Core commit pinned in `solutions/afternoon-2/apm.yml` still resolves. If you bump it, update the workshop text as well.
5. Preflight the four-entry template catalog and source-qualified HVE transition
   in disposable CLI/VS Code profiles. Verify the reviewed HVE version/agents and
   final personal disable leave repository agents visible. Prepare the app setup
   demo and private accessibility report; the private `coffeesoft` visual is optional
   historical context, not required attendee access.
6. Capture the screenshots listed in each `assets/README.md`.
7. Check the latest [workshop tester](../tests/workshop/afternoon-2/README.md) run. It replays the whole lab on every change to `main`, and an open `[Workshop tester]` issue lists the steps that currently fail.

## Known risks and fallbacks

| Risk | Signal | Fallback |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RPI runs longer than planned | Research still running at +25 min | Tell attendees to accept the plan as-is, or continue from the facilitator's finished branch |
| Model output diverges between attendees | Different file layouts | Level 2 exploration deliberately varies; reconcile only the implementation handoff. Level 3 keeps the shared acceptance criteria and duplicate-add UX choice; compare behaviour (409, empty state, accessible feedback), not identical code |
| `apm install` takes a long time | Install still running | Start it first, then explain the lockfile and policy while it runs; blocked attendees can use `solutions/afternoon-2/apm.yml` as the reference |
| `apm audit` slow or stuck | No output after several minutes | Show the recorded output; point out that `--no-drift` exists and costs coverage |
| APM tag pin fails | Resolution error | Use the commit SHA pin from `solutions/afternoon-2/apm.yml` |
| `apm install` reports "No harness detected" | Install error | Add `--target copilot` |
| gh-aw workflow cannot authenticate | Run fails at the agent step | Check `permissions: copilot-requests: write`, or configure the `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` secret |
| Copilot cloud agent does not show the RPI Agent | Custom agent missing from the picker | Agents must be in `.github/agents` on the default branch; merge first |
| Copilot cloud agent setup fails | `copilot-setup-steps` job red | The Actions log shows the failing restore or build; the firewall is on by default |
| Ruleset creation fails | `gh api` returns 403 or 404 | In a Codespace, clear `GITHUB_TOKEN` so `gh` uses the attendee's login. The attendee needs the admin role on the repository; rulesets on private repositories need a supported plan. Create the ruleset from **Settings** > **Rules** > **Rulesets**, or demo it and continue |
| Delegated pull request shows no checks | Checks wait with **Approve and run workflows** | Expected: workflows on Copilot pull requests need a human approval. Approve them, then wait for the `test` check |
| Delegated pull request not ready at Level 6 | Session still running | Review the session log live, then review the facilitator's prerecorded pull request |
| Attendees chose different duplicate-add approaches | Debrief at the review gate | Compare each approach with the shared acceptance criteria and accessibility needs; differing conformant designs are valid |
| Copilot is missing from **Reviewers** | Copilot code review policy disabled, or the attendee has no licence that includes it | Enable the **Copilot code review** policy, or demo the review yourself |
| **Advanced Security** shows no Secret Protection or custom patterns | No GitHub Secret Protection licence for private repositories | Demo push protection from a licensed repository |
| Backlog reconciliation cannot read checks | Run reports missing criterion evidence | Verify `actions: read` and the Actions toolset; keep the issue open rather than infer success |
| Backlog run leaves an issue unchanged | No evidence update | Check `backlog-managed`, actual planning/PR links, unchanged evidence, operation caps, and safe-output logs |
| Managed plugin cannot be disabled | CLI rejects the toggle | Explain enterprise-managed activation and distinguish the repository entries; do not bypass managed settings |
| Project status stays unchanged | Issue comment exists but card did not move | Expected for intermediate states: people set them. Verify the configured closed-item workflow for Done |
| Backlog Executor cannot create issues | The PM track stops at `/backlog-execute` | Restart Copilot CLI with `--enable-all-github-mcp-tools`, or sign in to the GitHub MCP server in VS Code; fallback: `gh issue create` from `handoff.md` |
| Security Reviewer missing for Copilot cloud agent | The custom agent is not listed, or the assignment ignores it | Check that `.github\agents\security-reviewer.agent.md` is on the default branch; otherwise assign without a custom agent |
| Security delegation workflow does nothing | The label was added but no assignment happened | Check the `GH_AW_AGENT_TOKEN` secret and that the issue still has the `security-review` label |

## Messaging guardrails

- Keep units distinct. Tokens, AI credits, legacy premium requests and external API cost are **different** units.
- Never state that Auto, HydraFusion or harness choice is the cheapest option. Measure actual usage instead. This applies to the model decision guide in the architect capstone too.
- Present HydraFusion as a **Research Preview** only.
- Policy auditing needs no `apm experimental enable` step. Upstream documentation labels `--policy` experimental; distinguish that maturity label from an activation requirement.
- Present the import of HVE agents into gh-aw as a **workshop pattern**, not a product feature.
