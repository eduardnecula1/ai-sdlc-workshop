# GitHub Copilot Zero to Hero

*Version 1.2 - September 2026*

Welcome to **GitHub Copilot Zero to Hero**. In this lab you go from your first code suggestion to plugins that bundle a whole team setup. It is the first lab of a two-part series for technical staff in an insurance and reinsurance context. The second lab, **AI SDLC with Github Copilot and HVE Core**, builds on everything you practise here.

Rather than duplicating existing material, this lab runs the official hands-on lab **[GitHub Copilot, your new AI pair programmer](https://moaw.dev/workshop/gh:Philess/GHCopilotHoL/main/docs/)** (GHCopilotHoL) on its companion application [Philess/gh-copilot-demo](https://github.com/Philess/gh-copilot-demo). This guide gives you the timed route through that lab and adds three short levels for primitives the lab does not cover yet: **Agent Skills**, **Copilot CLI**, and **Agent Plugins**.

During this lab you will:

- Accept and steer code completions.
- Use Copilot Chat to explain, fix, and test code.
- Let agent mode plan and implement a change, then review the diff.
- Shape Copilot with custom instructions, prompt files, MCP servers, and custom agents.
- Delegate a task to Copilot cloud agent on github.com.
- Package task knowledge as an Agent Skill.
- Drive the same primitives from the terminal with Copilot CLI.
- On the advanced track, layer instructions, add a guardrail hook, and review how MCP servers are governed.
- Install, inspect, and remove a plugin from a marketplace.

<div class="warning" data-title="Product evolution">

> GitHub Copilot, VS Code, Copilot CLI, MCP, and Agent Plugins evolve quickly. Copilot coding agent is now documented as **Copilot cloud agent**; the upstream lab may still use the old name. The upstream lab is also maintained independently of this guide. When a screen, label, or step looks different, check the linked documentation and adapt without changing the learning objective.

## 🎓 Key concepts

This is a quick reminder of what you will practise, not a lecture. Each concept links to its reference documentation.

### Interaction modes

| Mode | What it does | You stay in control by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Code completions](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/completions/code-suggestions) | Suggests the next lines as you type | Accepting, rejecting, or rewording the comment |
| [Chat](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-chat) | Answers questions with your code as context | Choosing the context you attach |
| [Agent mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/agents/overview) | Edits files and runs commands to reach a goal | Approving tools and reviewing the diff |
| [Plan](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/agents/planning) | Writes a plan before any change | Reviewing the plan before implementation |
| [Copilot CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/copilot-cli/about-copilot-cli) | Runs the agent in your terminal | Approving tools and paths per session |
| [Copilot cloud agent](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/cloud-agent/about-cloud-agent) | Works on an issue in GitHub Actions and opens a pull request | Reviewing and merging the pull request |

The further you go down this table, the more autonomy you hand over, and the more the review step matters.

### Copilot primitives

Primitives are the files that carry your team's context to Copilot:

| Primitive | What it carries | Where it lives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Custom instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/configure-custom-instructions/add-repository-instructions) | Always-on conventions | `.github\copilot-instructions.md`, `*.instructions.md` |
| [Prompt files](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/prompt-files) | Reusable tasks you invoke by name | `*.prompt.md` |
| [Custom agents](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/custom-agents) | A persona with its own tools and rules | `*.agent.md` |
| [Agent skills](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/about-agent-skills) | Task knowledge loaded on demand | `skills\<name>\SKILL.md` |
| [MCP servers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/mcp-servers) | External tools and data | `mcp.json` |
| [Plugins](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/agent-plugins) and [marketplaces](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-cli/customize-copilot/plugins-finding-installing) | A bundle of primitives and a catalogue to share it | `plugin.json`, `marketplace.json` |

Principles to keep in mind:

- **Context is the product.** The quality of the output depends on the context that you give. Primitives make that context explicit, reviewable, and versioned.
- **Small, well-scoped tasks win.** Split big asks into steps that you can verify.
- **You own the result.** Copilot proposes; you review, test, and commit.

### What comes next

**AI SDLC with Github Copilot and HVE Core** reuses these primitives at team and organization scale: HVE-Core for Design Thinking and the Research, Plan, Implement, Review (RPI) workflow, APM to version and govern agent packages, GitHub agentic workflows for backlog automation, and controlled delegation to Copilot cloud agent.

## How to use this guide

You will work in two browser tabs:

1. **This guide**: the order of the blocks, links to the upstream lab, and the extra Levels 7 to 9.
2. **The upstream lab**: the step-by-step content for Levels 1 to 6.

When a section below says **Open upstream Level N**, switch to the lab tab, complete that level, then come back here for the next section.

### Choose your track

| Track | For | Upstream Levels 1 to 4 | Extra time goes to |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Standard** | Developers new to Copilot, or using only completions and Chat | Hands-on, in the session | Levels 7 to 9 |
| **Fast track** | Advanced developers and architects who already use agent mode daily | Self-paced pre-work before the session, or a short facilitator demo | The **Advanced track: Deeper primitives** page, between Level 8 and Level 9 |

Both tracks do upstream Levels 5 and 6 and Levels 7 to 9. On the standard track, the Deeper primitives page is optional for early finishers. Your facilitator tells you which track the session runs.

## 🚀 Dev Environment Setup

### Requirements

| | |
| --- | --- |
| GitHub account with a Copilot licence | Copilot Business or Enterprise recommended. Copilot cloud agent and plugins may need administrator enablement. |
| A fork of [Philess/gh-copilot-demo](https://github.com/Philess/gh-copilot-demo) | Every option below starts from your fork. |
| A browser | For this guide, the upstream lab, and github.com. |

Complete the [prerequisites and pre-D-Day checks](https://github.com/Justrebl/AI-SDLC-Workshop/blob/main/docs/prerequisites.md) before the session. They cover the licence, VS Code, Docker or Podman, network allowlist, and organization settings. For a checklist limited to your delivery option, use [Codespaces](https://github.com/Justrebl/AI-SDLC-Workshop/blob/main/docs/before-d-day-codespace.md), [local dev container](https://github.com/Justrebl/AI-SDLC-Workshop/blob/main/docs/before-d-day-devcontainer.md) or [local tools](https://github.com/Justrebl/AI-SDLC-Workshop/blob/main/docs/before-d-day-local.md).

Fork the demo repository first: open [Philess/gh-copilot-demo](https://github.com/Philess/gh-copilot-demo), select **Fork**, and keep your own account as the owner.

Then choose **one** of the three options below. They are ordered from the fastest to the most hands-on.

### 🥇 Option 1: GitHub Codespaces

Nothing to install. The fork ships a [dev container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) with .NET, Node.js, the Copilot extensions, and the project dependencies.

1. In your fork, select **Code** → **Codespaces** → **Create codespace on main**.
2. Wait until `postCreateCommand` prints `Setup complete`.
3. Install Copilot CLI in the Codespace terminal for Levels 8 and 9: `npm install -g @github/copilot`.

<div class="info" data-title="Codespaces usage">

> Codespaces usage is billed by compute and storage, separately from Copilot. Check what applies to your account in [About billing for GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/about-billing-for-github-codespaces). Stop or delete the Codespace at the end of the lab.

</div>

### 🥈 Option 2: Dev container on your machine

Same environment as Option 1, running in Docker on your machine.

1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) or a compatible engine, VS Code, and the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers).
2. Clone your fork and open it in VS Code.
3. Run **Dev Containers: Reopen in Container** from the Command Palette.
4. Install Copilot CLI in the container terminal: `npm install -g @github/copilot`.

### 🥉 Option 3: Local tools

Install the tools yourself, then clone your fork:

| Tool | Why |
| --- | --- |
| [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with GitHub Copilot and GitHub Copilot Chat | Levels 1 to 7 and 9 |
| [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) | Commit checkpoints |
| [Node.js 22 LTS](https://nodejs.org/) | Upstream front end and Copilot CLI install |
| [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) | Upstream `albums-api`. Use the version listed in the upstream README. |
| [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) | Sign-in and repository commands |
| [Copilot CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/set-up/install-copilot-cli) | Levels 8 and 9 |

<div class="tip" data-title="Recommendation">

> Use **Option 1** unless your organization blocks Codespaces. It removes local setup issues and gives every participant the same environment.

</div>
<div class="important" data-title="Synthetic data only">

> Do not paste customer data, confidential code, credentials, or production telemetry into prompts, issues, or Copilot cloud agent tasks. The demo application uses sample album data only.

</div>

# Setup: Prepare your workshop environment

## Topic

You will fork the upstream demo application, open it in Codespaces or locally, and check that Copilot is signed in.

## Follow the upstream setup

### Step 1: Open the upstream introduction

Open the [GHCopilotHoL introduction](https://moaw.dev/workshop/gh:Philess/GHCopilotHoL/main/docs/) and follow these sections:

- **Get Access to GitHub Copilot**.
- **Fork the repository** to fork [Philess/gh-copilot-demo](https://github.com/Philess/gh-copilot-demo) into your own account.
- **OPTION 1: Work with GitHub Codespaces** or **OPTION 2: Work locally**.
- **How to run the code?** Run at least the front end, as the upstream lab requires.

Success Criteria:
- You own a fork of `gh-copilot-demo`.
- The repository contains `album-viewer`, `albums-api`, `iac`, `legacy`, and `.github`.
- Copilot is signed in in VS Code or in your Codespace.

### Step 2: Create a baseline checkpoint

Check for existing edits, then create an `afternoon-1` branch to keep the workshop changes separate from your default branch. Run from the repository root:

```powershell
git status
git checkout -b afternoon-1
```

Success Criteria:
- Your working tree is clean.
- Git reports `afternoon-1` as the current branch.

<div class="tip" data-title="Two tabs">

> Keep this guide open in one tab and the upstream lab in another. This guide tells you when to switch.

</div>

---

# Part 1: GitHub Copilot hands-on lab, Levels 1 to 4

## Topic

You will learn completions, Chat, agent mode, and the plan-then-implement loop using the upstream lab.

<div class="tip" data-title="Fast track">

> On the fast track, complete these four levels as pre-work or watch the facilitator demo, then make sure your fork has the commit checkpoint below. Review the plan before implementation so scope errors are caught before they become code changes. Every later level builds on that practice.

</div>

## Open upstream Level 1: Code Completion

Open [Level 1](https://moaw.dev/workshop/gh:Philess/GHCopilotHoL/main/docs/?step=1).

Focus on:
- Ghost text and accepting suggestions.
- Comment-driven generation.
- **Big tasks vs small tasks**: why smaller, well-scoped prompts produce better results.

The side quests on commit messages and documentation are optional.

## Open upstream Level 2: Copilot Chat

Open [Level 2](https://moaw.dev/workshop/gh:Philess/GHCopilotHoL/main/docs/?step=2).

Focus on:
- Chat participants, context variables, and slash commands.
- Everyday tasks: explaining, fixing, and testing code.

## Open upstream Level 3: Copilot Agent Basics

Open [Level 3](https://moaw.dev/workshop/gh:Philess/GHCopilotHoL/main/docs/?step=3).

Focus on:
- When agent mode edits files and runs commands.
- Reviewing the diff before keeping changes.

## Open upstream Level 4: Copilot Plan & Implement

Open [Level 4](https://moaw.dev/workshop/gh:Philess/GHCopilotHoL/main/docs/?step=4).

Focus on:
- Planning before implementing.
- The Code Review agent.

<div class="info" data-title="Link to AI SDLC with Github Copilot and HVE Core">

> The plan-then-implement loop you practice here becomes the full **Research, Plan, Implement, Review** (RPI) workflow in **AI SDLC with Github Copilot and HVE Core**.

</div>

## Commit checkpoint

Save the reviewed upstream exercises as a checkpoint before adding repository customizations. Check the diff for unrelated files, then run from the repository root:

```powershell
git status
git add -A; git commit -m "Complete upstream Levels 1 to 4"
```

---

# Break

Before the break, make sure your working tree is committed. After the break, you will move to repository-level customization, MCP, and agents on github.com.

---

# Part 2: GitHub Copilot hands-on lab, Levels 5 and 6

## Topic

You will customize Copilot for the repository and delegate work to agents on github.com.

## Open upstream Level 5: Advanced Copilot Concepts

Open [Level 5](https://moaw.dev/workshop/gh:Philess/GHCopilotHoL/main/docs/?step=5).

Focus on:
- **Custom Instructions**: `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and path-specific instructions.
- **Build your prompts library**: reusable prompt files and custom agent definitions.
- **Advanced Context Manipulations**: adding tools and context through MCP servers.

Prompt engineering techniques are a short read; skim them if time is tight.

## Open upstream Level 6: Leveraging agents on the platform

Open [Level 6](https://moaw.dev/workshop/gh:Philess/GHCopilotHoL/main/docs/?step=6).

Focus on:
- Assigning an issue to Copilot cloud agent and reviewing its pull request.
- Using your custom agents on github.com.

<div class="warning" data-title="Copilot cloud agent availability">

> Copilot cloud agent needs a supported plan and may need to be enabled by an administrator. If it is not available in your account, follow along with the facilitator's demo and continue.

</div>

## Commit checkpoint

Pull any merged Copilot cloud agent changes, then run:

```powershell
git status
git add -A; git commit -m "Complete upstream Levels 5 and 6"
```

---

# Level 7: Agent Skills

## Topic

You will package reusable procedural knowledge as an Agent Skill in your fork and see Copilot load it on demand. Official docs:
- https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/agent-skills
- https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/about-agent-skills

## What is an Agent Skill?

A custom agent defines **who** is working: a role, tools, and behavior. An Agent Skill defines **how** to do a specific task: a folder containing a `SKILL.md` file, plus optional scripts or templates. Copilot reads the skill's `description` and loads the full content only when the task matches. This keeps context small until the knowledge is needed.

| Primitive | Loaded when | Good for |
| --------- | ----------- | -------- |
| Custom instructions | Always, or by file path | Stable conventions |
| Prompt files | When you invoke them | Repeatable requests |
| Custom agents | When you select them | Roles and tool boundaries |
| Agent Skills | When the task matches the description | Procedures and domain know-how |

## Create an albums-api endpoint skill

### Step 1: Create the skill folder

Give Copilot a reusable procedure for this API instead of repeating the conventions in every request. At the root of your fork, create the skill folder:

```text
.github\skills\albums-api-endpoint
```

### Step 2: Create the skill file

Define when the skill should load and the endpoint procedure it supplies. Create `.github\skills\albums-api-endpoint\SKILL.md` with this content:

```markdown
---
name: albums-api-endpoint
description: Add or change an HTTP endpoint in the albums-api .NET project. Use when asked to create, modify, or document an albums-api route.
---

## Albums API endpoint procedure

1. Read `albums-api/Controllers` and follow the existing controller style.
2. Keep models in `albums-api/Models`. Do not add a database; the sample data stays in memory.
3. Return typed results and appropriate status codes (200, 201, 400, 404).
4. After the change, run `dotnet build` from `albums-api` and report the result.
5. Summarize the new route, its verb, and an example `curl` call.
```

Success Criteria:
- `.github\skills\albums-api-endpoint\SKILL.md` exists with the supplied `name`, `description`, and five procedure steps. You will commit it at the checkpoint below.

### Step 3: Use the skill from Chat

Ask Copilot to add an endpoint so you can verify that the new skill is loaded and its build step is followed. Open Copilot Chat in **Agent** mode and send:

```text
Add a GET endpoint to albums-api that returns the number of albums. Follow the repository conventions.
```

Success Criteria:
- Copilot loads the `albums-api-endpoint` skill. Check the references or tool calls in the response.
- The change follows the five steps of the skill, including `dotnet build` and a `curl` example.

<div class="tip" data-title="Skill not picked up?">

> Skills are matched by their `description`. If Copilot does not load it, make the description more specific, or mention "use the albums-api-endpoint skill" in your prompt. Check that your VS Code version supports Agent Skills.

</div>

## Commit checkpoint

Review the diff, then run:

```powershell
git status
git add -A; git commit -m "Add albums-api endpoint skill"
```

---

# Level 8: Copilot CLI

## Topic

You will use GitHub Copilot CLI from the repository root. You will trust the folder, sign in, explain the repository, inspect model selection, make a change, use shell escape, reuse your custom agent and skill, and try programmatic mode carefully. Official docs:
- https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-cli

![Copilot CLI in terminal](assets/level8-cli-start.png)

## Install and start the CLI

### Step 1: Install the CLI

Install the CLI so you can use the repository's Copilot customizations from a terminal. Skip installation if `copilot` is already available:

```powershell
npm install -g @github/copilot
```

Success Criteria:
- The `copilot` command is available in a new terminal.

### Step 2: Start from the repository root

Start an interactive session in your fork so Copilot loads this repository's context:

```powershell
copilot
```

Success Criteria:
- The CLI opens an interactive session.

If the CLI asks for folder trust, continue to the next step before allowing workspace tools.

### Step 3: Trust the folder

Trust the folder only if it is your workshop fork.

<div class="warning" data-title="Folder trust">

> Trusting a folder allows the CLI to read files and, with your approval, run tools in that workspace. Do not trust random downloaded repositories.

</div>

## Sign in and inspect help

### Step 1: Sign in

Connect the CLI to your Copilot account so the session can use its authorized models and services:

```text
/login
```

Complete the browser authentication flow if prompted.

### Step 2: Open help

Display the commands supported by this installed CLI version rather than relying on a command list from another release:

```text
/help
```

Success Criteria:
- The help view lists the commands supported by your installed version.

Use that view as the source of truth when a workshop command differs in your release.

### Step 3: Check usage

Inspect the CLI's account usage view before making more requests:

```text
/usage
```

Success Criteria:
- The CLI shows the usage information available to your account and plan.

<div class="info" data-title="Usage units">

> Copilot usage is measured in units that depend on the experience and on your plan. **AI SDLC with Github Copilot and HVE Core** covers how to read them. Do not compare CLI and VS Code usage without checking which unit each one reports.

</div>

## Ask the CLI to explain the repository

Ask for a read-only repository map before requesting edits. The response should identify the projects and their run commands without changing files:

```text
Explain this repository in ten bullets. Include the front end, the albums API, the infrastructure folder, the legacy folder, and the commands to run the app. Do not modify files.
```

Success Criteria:
- The CLI mentions `album-viewer`, `albums-api`, `iac`, and `legacy`.
- It does not change any file.

![CLI repository explanation](assets/level8-cli-explain.png)

## Choose a model

Open the model picker to inspect the models allowed by your account and organization:

```text
/model
```

Success Criteria:
- The model picker lists your available model choices.

Keep the default or choose the model your facilitator recommends. Model comparison and Auto selection are covered in **AI SDLC with Github Copilot and HVE Core**.

## Make a change from the CLI

### Step 1: Reuse your skill

Use the endpoint skill from Level 7 for a new artist filter while preserving the existing routes:

```text
Add a GET endpoint to albums-api that returns albums filtered by artist name. Use the albums-api-endpoint skill. Do not change existing endpoints.
```

Success Criteria:
- The CLI asks for permission before editing files or running commands.
- It uses the skill you created in Level 7 and runs `dotnet build`.

### Step 2: Use shell escape

Use shell escape to inspect the actual working-tree changes without leaving the Copilot session:

```text
! git status --short
```

Success Criteria:
- The CLI prints the Git status without leaving the session.

### Step 3: Select a custom agent

Open the agent picker to reuse a repository specialist for a read-only review of your change:

```text
/agent
```

Select one of the custom agents you created in upstream Level 5 or 6, if listed. Ask it a short, read-only question about the change you just made.

Success Criteria:
- The selected custom agent appears as the active agent, and its response addresses the change without adding file edits.

<div class="tip" data-title="One set of customizations">

> Instructions, prompt files, agents, and skills committed in `.github` are shared by VS Code, the CLI, and agents on github.com when the surface supports them. Commit them so the whole team gets the same behavior.

</div>

## Programmatic mode

The CLI can run one prompt non-interactively with `-p`. Exit the interactive session, then run a read-only prompt:

```powershell
copilot -p "List the commands needed to build and run this repository. Do not edit files."
```

Success Criteria:
- The CLI prints a summary and exits.

<div class="warning" data-title="Tool allow flags">

> Programmatic mode is useful in scripts and pipelines. Documented flags such as `--allow-tool` and `--allow-all-tools` widen what the CLI may do without asking. Prefer the narrowest permission, and avoid `--allow-all-tools` unless the repository is trusted and your organization policy allows it.

</div>

## Commit checkpoint

Review the diff, then run:

```powershell
git status
git add -A; git commit -m "Add artist filter endpoint from Copilot CLI"
```

# Advanced track: Deeper primitives

## Topic

On the fast track, this page uses the time saved on upstream Levels 1 to 4. On the standard track, it is optional for early finishers. You will look at three things that matter once you roll Copilot out to a team: how instructions are **layered**, how a **hook** can stop a tool call, and how **MCP servers** are governed. Official docs:
- https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/configure-custom-instructions/add-repository-instructions
- https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/hooks
- https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/administer-copilot/manage-mcp-usage/configure-mcp-server-access

Why this page: up to now, each primitive added context. Real teams also need to know which context wins when several files apply, and how to limit what an agent can do, not only what it knows.

## Layer instructions

### What gets loaded, and from where

Copilot can combine several instruction sources in one request:

| Layer | Where it lives | Applies when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Personal | Your own settings, for example VS Code user instructions or `~/.copilot` for Copilot CLI | Every request you make, in any repository |
| Repository-wide | `.github\copilot-instructions.md` | Every request in this repository |
| Path-specific | `.github\instructions\*.instructions.md`, with an `applyTo` glob | Only when the files involved match the glob |

When instructions conflict, personal instructions take precedence over repository instructions, and repository instructions take precedence over organization instructions. All the relevant layers are still sent, so the best fix for a conflict is to remove it, not to rely on the order.

### Step 1: Add a path-specific instruction

Create `.github\instructions\albums-api.instructions.md` with this content:

```markdown
---
applyTo: "albums-api/**"
---

- Add an XML documentation comment (`/// <summary>`) to every public controller action you add or change in albums-api.
- Keep the existing controller style. Do not add a database.
```

### Step 2: Check that the layer applies

Request an API change to verify that its matching path-specific instruction adds XML documentation. Open Copilot Chat in **Agent** mode, or start `copilot` from the repository root, and send:

```text
Add a GET endpoint to albums-api that returns the albums released in a given year. Follow the repository conventions.
```

Success Criteria:
- The new controller action has a `/// <summary>` comment.
- In VS Code, the references of the response list `albums-api.instructions.md` next to the repository-wide instructions and the `albums-api-endpoint` skill from Level 7.

Then ask for a small change in `album-viewer`, such as a new label text. The `albums-api` instruction is not in the references, because its `applyTo` glob does not match.

<div class="tip" data-title="Context engineering">

> Each layer costs context. Keep repository-wide instructions short and stable, push folder-specific rules into path-specific files, and keep step-by-step procedures in skills that load only when the task matches. **AI SDLC with Github Copilot and HVE Core** applies the same idea to the Research, Plan, Implement, Review workflow, where each phase writes a file instead of relying on a long chat history.

</div>

## Add a guardrail hook

A **hook** is a command that runs at a fixed point in an agent session. A `preToolUse` hook runs before each tool call and can deny it. Repository hooks live in `.github\hooks\*.json` and apply to Copilot CLI and Copilot cloud agent in this repository.

### Step 1: Create the hook scripts

Create `.github\hooks\scripts\deny-push.sh` with this content:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Denies any shell command that runs git push. Other tool calls follow the normal approval flow.
input=$(cat)
if printf '%s' "$input" | grep -Eq 'git[[:space:]]+push'; then
  echo '{"permissionDecision":"deny","permissionDecisionReason":"Pushing is a human decision in this repository."}'
fi
```

Create `.github\hooks\scripts\deny-push.ps1` with this content:

```powershell
# Denies any shell command that runs git push. Other tool calls follow the normal approval flow.
$hookInput = [Console]::In.ReadToEnd()
if ($hookInput -match 'git\s+push') {
  '{"permissionDecision":"deny","permissionDecisionReason":"Pushing is a human decision in this repository."}'
}
```

The hook reads the tool call as JSON on its standard input. When it prints nothing, Copilot follows its normal approval flow.

### Step 2: Register the hook

Create `.github\hooks\guardrails.json` with this content:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "hooks": {
    "preToolUse": [
      {
        "type": "command",
        "bash": "bash ./.github/hooks/scripts/deny-push.sh",
        "powershell": "./.github/hooks/scripts/deny-push.ps1",
        "timeoutSec": 10
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Test the hook

Exercise the hook with a dry-run push: the command should be denied before Git executes, without publishing anything. Start `copilot` from the repository root and send:

```text
Run git push --dry-run and show me the output.
```

Success Criteria:
- The CLI reports that the tool call was denied, with the reason "Pushing is a human decision in this repository."
- A prompt such as "Run git status" still works.

<div class="warning" data-title="A guardrail, not a security boundary">

> This hook matches text. A command such as `git -C . push` does not match the pattern, and a hook that times out lets the call through. Use hooks to catch mistakes and to log what agents do. Use branch rulesets, token permissions, and the cloud agent firewall for the limits that must hold. **AI SDLC with Github Copilot and HVE Core** builds on those controls.

</div>

## Review MCP governance

### Step 1: Inventory your MCP servers

Inventory the configured servers before enabling more MCP tools. Open Copilot Chat in **Ask** mode, or start `copilot`, and request a read-only report:

```text
Read the MCP configuration in this repository, such as .vscode/mcp.json. For each server, list whether it runs as a local process or a remote URL, which credentials or environment variables it receives, and which tools it exposes. Then say what could go wrong if untrusted text from an issue or a web page reached that server. Do not start servers or edit files.
```

Success Criteria:
- The report has one row per configured server, with transport, exposed tools, and credential/environment-variable names. Secret values are not reproduced.
- No server is started and no configuration file is changed.

### Step 2: Narrow the tools

In VS Code Chat, open **Configure Tools** and turn off the MCP tools that this repository does not need. Fewer tools means less context for the model and fewer actions that a misleading prompt can trigger. Some servers also offer narrower modes. For example, the GitHub MCP server can run with selected toolsets or in read-only mode.

### Step 3: Know the organization controls

| Control | Who sets it | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **MCP servers in Copilot** policy | Enterprise or organization owner | Turns MCP use on or off for members |
| MCP registry URL, with an allowlist option | Enterprise or organization owner | Points Copilot to an approved list of servers, and can limit use to that list where your editor supports it |
| Repository MCP configuration | Repository maintainers | Shares a reviewed set of servers with the team: `.vscode\mcp.json` through pull requests for VS Code, and the repository's Copilot settings for Copilot cloud agent |

See [Configure MCP server access](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/administer-copilot/manage-mcp-usage/configure-mcp-server-access) for the current options. In **AI SDLC with Github Copilot and HVE Core**, an APM policy file adds another check: it blocks MCP servers that a package defines on its own.

## Commit checkpoint

Review the diff, then run:

```powershell
git status
git add -A; git commit -m "Add path-specific instructions and a guardrail hook"
```

# Level 9: Agent Plugins and marketplaces

## Topic

You will learn what Agent Plugins bundle, browse a plugin marketplace from the CLI and from VS Code, install and inspect one plugin, then uninstall it. Official docs:
- https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-cli/customize-copilot/plugins-finding-installing
- https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/agent-plugins

![Agent Plugins marketplace](assets/level9-plugin-marketplace.png)

## What are Agent Plugins?

You created customizations one file at a time today. A plugin **bundles** them so a team can share them:

- Custom agents.
- Agent Skills.
- Prompt files.
- Hooks.
- MCP server configuration.

A **marketplace** is a GitHub repository that lists plugins. **AI SDLC with Github Copilot and HVE Core** uses the HVE-Core marketplace and a repository-owned APM package to share an entire methodology.

<div class="warning" data-title="Hooks and MCP can run code">

> Treat plugins like code dependencies. Inspect what they add before trusting them. Hooks and MCP server configuration can execute commands or connect external tools.

</div>

## Browse and install from the CLI

### Step 1: List marketplaces

List the catalogs already registered with this CLI so you can choose an actual marketplace name:

```powershell
copilot plugin marketplace list
```

Success Criteria:
- The CLI lists the configured marketplaces, such as `github/copilot-plugins` or `github/awesome-copilot`, depending on your version.

### Step 2: Browse a marketplace

Browse the selected catalog before installing anything. Replace the placeholder with a marketplace name from the previous list:

```powershell
copilot plugin marketplace browse <marketplace-name>
```

Pick one small plugin that does not request secrets or broad system access.

### Step 3: Install and inspect

Install the chosen plugin into your Copilot environment, then list installed plugins to confirm it was added:

```powershell
copilot plugin install <plugin>@<marketplace-name>
copilot plugin list
```

Inspect what that install exposed before using its capabilities. Start `copilot` and request a read-only inventory:

```text
Explain what the installed plugin added to my Copilot environment. Focus on agents, skills, prompts, hooks, and MCP configuration. Do not run plugin tools or modify files.
```

Success Criteria:
- `copilot plugin list` includes the selected plugin.
- The report identifies its agents, skills, prompts, hooks, and MCP configuration where present, with references to the relevant files.
- No plugin tool is executed and no repository file is changed.

### Step 4: Uninstall

Remove the demo plugin so the next workshop starts without its extra capabilities. Exit the CLI and uninstall the same plugin:

```powershell
copilot plugin uninstall <plugin>
```

Success Criteria:
- The CLI reports successful removal of the selected plugin; the repository customization files remain unchanged.

## Browse from VS Code

Compare CLI discovery with VS Code's plugin catalog. Open the Extensions view and use this filter:

```text
@agentPlugins
```

Success Criteria:
- The filtered Extensions view lists available agent plugins.

If the view is unavailable, your build may require `chat.plugins.enabled`, or your account may not support plugins yet. Record that limitation rather than count it as a completed catalog check.

<div class="tip" data-title="Why uninstall?">

> Uninstalling keeps all participants aligned for **AI SDLC with Github Copilot and HVE Core**. In real projects, keep only approved plugins and record why the team uses them. The second lab shows how APM and policies make that decision versioned and auditable.

</div>

# Recap: Choose the right primitive

## What you practiced

Today you used GitHub Copilot as a layered toolchain rather than one feature. You started with completions and Chat, moved to agent mode and plan-then-implement, stored durable guidance in instructions and prompt files, connected tools through MCP, delegated to Copilot cloud agent, packaged know-how as an Agent Skill, reused it from the CLI, and inspected how plugins bundle everything for sharing.

## The autonomy ladder

Each rung hands Copilot more autonomy, so each rung needs a stronger review step:

| Rung | Who decides each step | Your review step | Covered in |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Code completion | You, line by line | Accept or reject each suggestion | Upstream Level 1 |
| 2. Chat | You, answer by answer | Read the answer before you use it | Upstream Level 2 |
| 3. Agent mode | The agent, inside your editor | Approve tools, review the diff | Upstream Level 3 |
| 4. Plan, then implement | The agent, after you approve a plan | Review the plan before any change, then the diff | Upstream Level 4 |
| 5. Copilot CLI | The agent, in your terminal and scripts | Approve tools and paths, keep allow flags narrow | Level 8 |
| 6. Copilot cloud agent | The agent, in GitHub Actions, without you | Review the pull request, its checks, and its session log | Upstream Level 6 |

<div class="info" data-title="Why the cloud agent came before the CLI">

> The upstream lab reaches the top rung in Level 6, before this guide adds Copilot CLI in Level 8. Read the ladder by autonomy, not by level number: the CLI still runs on your machine, under your eyes, while Copilot cloud agent works on its own and you see only the result. Levels 7 to 9 and the Deeper primitives page add the primitives that make the top rung safe: skills for repeatable procedures, hooks for guardrails, and plugins for shared, reviewed setups.

</div>

## Primitive selection table

| Primitive | Where it lives | When to use | Covered in |
| --------- | -------------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| Code completion | Editor | Fast local suggestions while you type | Upstream Level 1 |
| Copilot Chat | VS Code Chat | Explanations, fixes, and tests | Upstream Level 2 |
| Agent mode | VS Code Chat | Multi-file changes with commands | Upstream Level 3 |
| Plan, then implement | VS Code Chat | Scoping work before editing | Upstream Level 4 |
| Custom instructions | `.github` folder | Stable team conventions | Upstream Level 5 |
| Prompt files | `.github\prompts` | Repeatable requests | Upstream Level 5 |
| MCP servers | MCP configuration | External tools and context | Upstream Level 5 |
| Copilot cloud agent and custom agents | github.com | Asynchronous delegated work | Upstream Level 6 |
| Agent Skills | `.github\skills` | Procedures loaded on demand | Level 7 |
| Copilot CLI | Terminal | Repository work without leaving the shell | Level 8 |
| Path-specific instructions | `.github\instructions` | Rules for one part of the code base | Upstream Level 5, Deeper primitives |
| Hooks | `.github\hooks` | Guardrails and audit logs around tool calls | Deeper primitives |
| Agent Plugins | CLI or VS Code | Sharing bundles of customizations | Level 9 |

<div class="important" data-title="The operating model">

> The professional workflow is not "ask Copilot to do everything". It is: scope the task, provide the right context, choose the smallest capable primitive, review changes, validate, and commit a clean checkpoint.

</div>

## What is next

**AI SDLC with Github Copilot and HVE Core** moves from primitives to a governed agentic SDLC on a new application: a **Music Catalog** mono-repo with a React + TypeScript front end in `src/front` and a .NET 10 API in `src/api`. The application changes because the second lab needs a repository that you copy and fully own, with tests and a Copilot cloud agent setup ready for HVE-Core, Design Thinking, RPI, APM policies, agentic workflows, and Copilot cloud agent delegation.

Continue with [AI SDLC with Github Copilot and HVE Core](../afternoon-2/workshop.md).
